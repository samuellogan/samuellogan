# Hi There!
Thanks for checking my github out - feel free to take a look at some of my projects! Here's a couple of my favourites:

### Boids
This is a little weekend project that I worked on that makes use of Swing for Java to simulate Boids. A boid is a conceptual model used to simulate the flocking behaviors of animals, such as birds and fish. Created by Craig Reynolds in 1986, the term itself is a portmanteau of "bird-oid object," indicating its origin in emulating the flight patterns of birds. The core idea behind boids is surprisingly simple, relying on three basic rules: separation (avoid crowding neighbors), alignment (steer towards the average heading of neighbors), and cohesion (steer towards the average position of neighbors). Despite the simplicity of these rules, when applied to a group of simulated agents, they result in complex, lifelike behavior that closely mirrors the natural flocking seen in wildlife.

### URL Shortner
This is another little project that makes use of Spring.js and acts as a URL shortening service. It stores shortened URLs in a SQLite database, and along with a basic webpage that acts as a frontend, acts as a very basic URL shortner.
